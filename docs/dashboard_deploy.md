# Deployment of the dashboard

## 1. Select a Deployment Platform

Choose a platform that best fits your needs for deploying the dashboard,
ensuring it aligns with your performance, scalability, and budget requirements.

## 2. Set Up CI/CD

To streamline development, implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This will automate testing and deployment,
allowing you to focus on building features and improving the dashboard without manual deployment steps.
