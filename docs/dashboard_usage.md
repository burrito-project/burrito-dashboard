# Additional notes

Before deploying the dashboard, make sure to:

- Ensure that a user account with the appropriate permissions
  is created in the database. This allows access control and
  ensures that each user can interact with the dashboard as
  expected.

- Verify that the backend server is running and accessible.
  The dashboard relies on the server for data retrieval
  and updates, so a live connection is essential for full
  functionality.
