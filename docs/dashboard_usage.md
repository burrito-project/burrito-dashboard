# Before Using or Sharing the Dasboard

## 1. Create a User in the Database

Ensure that a user account with the appropriate permissions is created in the database. This allows access control and ensures that each user can interact
with the dashboard as expected.

## 2. The server must be running

Verify that the backend server is running and accessible. The dashboard relies
on the server for data retrieval and updates, so a live connection is essential for full functionality.
